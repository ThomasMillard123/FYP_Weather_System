CRITICAL EVALUATION OF CURRENT WEATHER SYSTEMS 

This is a my final year project at staffordshier university-
It is atemting to demonstarat a methord of creating weather throught the use of air masses and a grid. The Grid is to genrate and hold data values to invdual parts of the world at diffrent hights. The air masses worked in a grate way alowing for zones of weather to happen but the gid prohibited the zone of being more complex as it works by just saying perciptat in the gird squares inberteeen in the front zone. Some inprovment that can happen is the removel of the grid system to hold and generate data. The potential of the weather effects could be inproved to make the system look better.

It is buit useing:
